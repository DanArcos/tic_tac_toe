A simple tic tac toe game. Currently allows for two players to play. The point of this project is to demonstrate the use of objects in an effort to minimize the presence of any global code.

The gameboard and display controllers are module, that is single instance object with their own respective properties and functions.

The Player object is made via a factory function, to allow for the creation of two unique instances.
